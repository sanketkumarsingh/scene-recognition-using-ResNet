# scene-recognition-using-ResNet

This repository contain code for our experiment with ResNET for scene recognition task.
We took sample code from tensorflow for cifar-10 and modified it for SUN 397 dataset and then added inference method for AlexNet and Residual Neural network. eval_once() method is further method to visualize the representation learned in hidden layers.
